## Student Data Analysis
This project focuses on the analysis of student data from a university. The main objective is to load student data from a CSV file, perform functional operations to filter and process the data, and present useful results such as the number of applicants per major, the average score per major, and the students with the highest scores, among others.

### Project Structure
The project is divided into two main files:

Main.java: Contains the main entry point and orchestrates the data analysis operations.
Students.java: Defines the Students class to represent student data and provides methods to access this data.

### Development Environment

This project was developed using Replit as the integrated development environment (IDE) for its ease of use and online accessibility.

- [Complete Version](https://replit.com/join/ttbohzhnzt-nickolas10moren)
    - This version includes all the necessary files and code to run the complete analysis of student data.
    - It offers an interactive platform to execute the code, view the results, and make any necessary modifications.

Feel free to test the code on Replit using the provided link. You can explore the functionalities, examine the codebase, and even make improvements if you wish.

## Haskell Functional Programming Project

The project encompasses the implementation of first-order functions, referential transparency, and parametric polymorphism in Haskell, along with an explanatory video that delves into these concepts in depth.

### Objective

The main objective of this project is to provide a clear and practical understanding of the essential concepts of functional programming in Haskell. It aims to demonstrate how first-order functions, referential transparency, and parametric polymorphism can be applied in practice, along with their importance in the development of robust and flexible programs.

### Explanatory Video

In the video/ folder, you will find a detailed explanatory video that accompanies this project. The video provides a clear and concise explanation of the concepts of first-order functions, referential transparency, and parametric polymorphism in Haskell, along with practical examples for better comprehension.
